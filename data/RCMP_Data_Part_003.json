On the night of June 29, Lisa travelled to a local bar, and met with some acquaintances. Lisa and her acquaintances accepted a ride from a man to an afterparty. Subsequently, Lisa left with this male driver to get some food, but communicated to her acquaintances that she would be returning to them via taxi. She has not been seen or heard from since. Based on investigational information, the Nanaimo RCMP Serious Crime Unit believes that she may have been met with foul play. Police request that anyone with information contact them directly.",
