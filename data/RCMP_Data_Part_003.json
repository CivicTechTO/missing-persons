On August 18, 1978, three members of the expedition were on shore guiding in a canoe. The remaining 5 members including Craig remained in the canoe. As these individuals labored to guide the canoe to shore, the rope was given some slack. This caused the bow of the canoe to turn out into the current, which in turn caused the canoe to tip. The individuals on shore were unable to hold onto the rope due to the strength of the current and the canoe was carried downstream. Craig hung onto the canoe for a couple hours then was seen letting go. He slipped under the water and did not resurface. Mr. Waldum's remains have not been recovered and foul play is not suspected in this matter.",

The facial bones were cut surgically and then moved, and the upper and lower jaws were re-adjusted, resulting in changes in the facial structure. It is also probable that the deceased had braces in adulthood. Spots on her lower teeth suggest that she might have been a smoker. She was believed to be in the tent for a day or two and not more than a week before she was discovered. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified woman is of European ancestry.",
