The Ontario Forensic Pathology Service has been able to determine that the remains are that of a male age 50-100 years old. Found on him was Canadian currency dated 2016, therefore it is believed he may have been there as early as the Spring of 2016. It is unknown how the male travelled to this area, but it is believed that he may have taken a bus, walked or hitchhiked.  He was carrying a back pack with camping supplies along with a firearm that would have been concealed in a cardboard box. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified male is of European ancestry.",

The plane was 18 minutes into its flight when the pilot communicated with Cleveland Air Traffic Control that they were encountering severe turbulence.  They requested new vectors to fly. The pilot was advised to turn west, then Air Traffic Control lost radio and radar contact with the plane. Debris from the plane was located on August 27, 1986 in Lake Erie, approximately 32 nautical miles south of the St.Thomas Airport. Debris was drifting in a southeast direction and was recovered approximately 1-3 nautical miles on the Canadian side of the international boundary line in Lake Erie. Debris was identified by Bud FIELD,  brother of Terry FIELD, as having come from the missing aircraft.",
