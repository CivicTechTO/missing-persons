It is believed they then stopped at a friends trappers cabin at Rat Hunting and ate a meal. The last thing the survivor remembers, is seeing the lights of Easterville and he crawled to the front of the boat where he fell asleep. He awoke around 0500 hrs the next day and Mr. Umpherville was no longer in the boat and he was adrift. Numerous islands in the area were searched, shorelines were searched and several air and water patrols were made without success. Mr. Umpherville has not been located and his whereabouts is unknown.",

Found on him was Canadian currency dated 2016, therefore it is believed he may have been there as early as the Spring of 2016. It is unknown how the male travelled to this area, but it is believed that he may have taken a bus, walked or hitchhiked.  He was carrying a back pack with camping supplies along with a firearm that would have been concealed in a cardboard box. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified male is of European ancestry.",
