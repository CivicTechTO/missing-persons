It is unknown if they intended to walk, hitchhike, or had other means to get there. The duo became disoriented and ended up wandering the highway and back roads for over 20 hours. It was learned that neither of them was prepared to be out for this period of time. At some point, Denny and his friend had a difference of opinion on whether they should continue on their journey or not, and the two ended up separating. The last confirmed sighting of Denny was just south of the Kiskatinaw Bridge on Highway 97. Denny has some disabilities and it is recommended that he be under adult supervision.",

While Henrik was in the shower, his wife Chieko and 1 year old son Takaya vanished. Henrik sought the assistance of police in Yokohama and the Canadian Embassy, to no avail. Shortly thereafter, Henrik attended 52 Division to report the incident and his subsequent attempt to locate his family. Toronto Police requested the assistance of Japanese police to confirm Chieko\u2019s and Takaya\u2019s well-being and Chieko\u2019s intentions.  It was confirmed that both are in good health and that Chieko does not wish her whereabouts be disclosed.",
