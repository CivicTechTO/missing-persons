He is described as balding, however, due to the length of time spent in the water, it is possible that his hair was lost after death giving the appearance of male pattern baldness. He is uncircumcised. His appendix is present. Changes to his heart suggest that he had high blood pressure and may have been treated for this.

When they arrived at the site, the men pulled the line attached to the net, but it didn't move. Increasing their efforts, the men pulled harder and the line attached to the weight came loose. The sudden shift caused both men to lose their footing and the canoe to overturn. The men attempted to move closer to shore by pushing the canoe. After a time, Mr. Harper told his friend he was too tired to hold on any longer. His companion continued moving the canoe. The survivor then realized Mr. Harper was no longer hanging on. Efforts to locate Mr. Harper were unsuccessful and it is presumed he drowned.",

Despite the progress they made, one wave eventually rolled the canoe. Both men hung onto the canoe for hours, but Robert eventually tired and let go.  When the friend eventually reached shore, he reported the incident. Dragging and diving operations were initiated and the results were negative. Mr. Ellis is presumed to have drowned.
