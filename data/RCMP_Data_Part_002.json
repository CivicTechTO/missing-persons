He is described as balding, however, due to the length of time spent in the water, it is possible that his hair was lost after death giving the appearance of male pattern baldness. He is uncircumcised. His appendix is present. Changes to his heart suggest that he had high blood pressure and may have been treated for this.

Both vessels proceeded west however after a time, the height of the waves increased (7 to 8 ft.). As a result the patrol boat had to increase power, which substantially increased the distance between the respective boats. Mr. Gorrie's boat was last seen a 1/2 mile behind the patrol. Immediate searches by air provided negative results. It is presumed that Mr. Gorrie drowned as he or the boat have never been located.",
