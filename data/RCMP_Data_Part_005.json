Mr. Gorrie followed the patrol boat for some time and eventually the family boarded the patrol boat while Mr. Gorrie continued to follow in his boat. Both vessels proceeded west however after a time, the height of the waves increased (7 to 8 ft.). As a result the patrol boat had to increase power, which substantially increased the distance between the respective boats. Mr. Gorrie's boat was last seen a 1/2 mile behind the patrol. Immediate searches by air provided negative results. It is presumed that Mr. Gorrie drowned as he or the boat have never been located.",
