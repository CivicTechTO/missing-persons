When he was unable to find her, he suspected that the dumpster may have been emptied during his absence. On October 3rd, video surveillance of the area confirmed that the dumpster had been picked up at 8:22 a.m. on October 1st. It also showed the departure of Janice's boyfriend, but no one else entering or leaving the dumpster. On October 5th, a major excavation of the landfill was started, but by the time the search was completed on October 14th, Janice had not been located.",

It is unknown if they intended to walk, hitchhike, or had other means to get there. The duo became disoriented and ended up wandering the highway and back roads for over 20 hours. It was learned that neither of them was prepared to be out for this period of time. At some point, Denny and his friend had a difference of opinion on whether they should continue on their journey or not, and the two ended up separating. The last confirmed sighting of Denny was just south of the Kiskatinaw Bridge on Highway 97. Denny has some disabilities and it is recommended that he be under adult supervision.",
