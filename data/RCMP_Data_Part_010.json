Steve Mysick was an outpatient of the Brandon Mental Hospital and had been staying with his friends for 2.5 years at the time of his disappearance.   Mr. Mysick was last seen at the CP train station in Brandon, Manitoba. It is likely Mr. Mysick purchased the ticket to Winnipeg as he had very limited funds available and had lived in Winnipeg in the past. There is no indication if Mr. Mysick actually boarded the train to Winnipeg.   Steve Mysick has never been located and his whereabouts is unknown. Foul play is not suspected.",
