The helicopter landed at Warren's Landing at approximately 5:20 p.m., and left for Winnipeg. The pilot reported that the weather was poor and he estimated his arrival in Winnipeg at 8:00 p.m. At 5:50 p.m. there was radio contact with the pilot where he stated that he was over Poplar River. This was the last radio contact with this helicopter.
