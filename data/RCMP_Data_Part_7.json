Early the following morning, Amber made a post on social media, which she constantly used to communicate with family and friends. Her social media account had no further activity after this time. It is unknown when she left her residence, what she was last wearing or how she may have left. Amber did not have access to a vehicle and would typically use public transit to get around. She lived a high risk lifestyle and seemed despondent on the night she was last seen.",
