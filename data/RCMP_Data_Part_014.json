The two men had been at a lodge operated by Mr. Newcombe at Mile 107 of the CPR line, west of Chapleau, Ontario. Mr. Weeden and Mr. Newcombe had planned a hunting trip and both were last seen between mile marker 106 and 107 of the CPR line southeast of White River and west of Chapleau. A large-scale search was conducted at the time, and again in the following spring (1960).  The search failed to locate the two men, and to date, they have not been located. Mr. Weeden exact date of birth is not known, but his year of birth is understood to be 1896 or 1897.",

Their intention was to go to Pointe du Bois to pick up supplies and then return to Whitedog. On November 5, 1974, these individuals were reported missing as they had never returned to Whitedog.  It is believed that the boat overturned and everyone drowned. Two bodies were recovered, and the cause of death was determined to be drowning. Searches were conducted by boat and by air but the bodies of Paul Scott and Richard Petawanahqueb were never recovered.  Mr. Scott and Mr. Petawanahqueb are presumed dead due to drowning. No foul play is suspected.",
