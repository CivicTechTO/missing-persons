It is also probable that the deceased had braces in adulthood. Spots on her lower teeth suggest that she might have been a smoker.

During this stop, they noticed a storm coming in. By the time they left there were already waves forming as they started out across the lake. The wind increased and the waves were so strong that they would almost cause the vessel to flip over. The boat filled with water and a wave took Mr. Harper out of the boat. His wife and child drifted in the boat until they reached shore and were later rescued. No foul play is suspected in this matter and it is presumed Mr. Harper drowned.",
