Two RCMP Twin Otters and an Air Search and Rescue Hercules conducted a search by air. It was not possible to search the lake by boat as there was too much ice on the lake.

It is believed he may have attempted to hitch-hike from the area as a passing motorist spotted someone matching his description.
