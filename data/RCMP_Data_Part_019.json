They departed the Umpherville settlement around 1300hrs and they briefly stopped at Pine Bluff around 1600 hrs. It is believed they then stopped at a friend's trappers cabin at Rat Hunting and ate a meal. The last thing the survivor remembers, is seeing the lights of Easterville and he crawled to the front of the boat where he fell asleep. He awoke around 0500 hrs the next day and Stanley was no longer in the boat and he was adrift. Numerous islands and shorelines in the area were searched, and several air and water patrols were made without success. Stanley has not been located and his whereabouts are unknown.",
