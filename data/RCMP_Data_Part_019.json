The party arrived in Fort Albany on July 18, 1984. At 6:00 p.m. that same day, the party decided to leave Fort Albany in an attempt to paddle to Moosonee via James Bay. The group had planned to go out onto James Bay with the tide and sail to Moosonee by lashing their canoes together. An intense storm engulfed the James Bay coastal area on July 23, 1984, and it is likely that the party perished on the Bay during this storm. Three victims were recovered in August 1984, twelve nautical miles North of the Moose River. Mr. Grinnell's body has never been recovered.",

Adolphe was in the lead boat with his hunting partner, and unbeknownst to him the second boat had to return to shore for motor repairs. Adolphe and his hunting partner never returned and were reported missing the next day. The body of Adolphe's hunting partner was discovered and the cause of death was determined to be drowning.
