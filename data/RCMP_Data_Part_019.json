This man reported sharing an intimate relationship with Belinda outside of his own marriage.  He said she was not a habitual runaway.  This man denied harming Belinda and through a Polygraph examination was determined to be honest.  The Victoria Police investigated Belinda's disappearance and determined that Belinda suffered from a mental illness, had a drug addiction and may have been a sex trade worker.  The last confirmed sighting of Belinda was at Shoppers Drug Mart at 870 Esquimalt Rd.  She failed to attend thereafter to pick up her daily medication.",

The men departed as a group in three separate boats and were heading for Warpath. At approximately 7:30 p.m. that same day, the occupants of the first boat reported to the RCMP that the other two boats were missing. They described the waves as being three to four feet high and they could not see the tree line from where they were. They lost sight of the other two boats and fired shotgun shots into the air hoping for a response. No response was received. Extensive patrols by air, boat and land were made in an attempt to locate the remaining five men. The bodies of Fredrick Ursu and Jerry Hudy were never recovered. Mr. Ursu and Mr. Hudy are presumed dead due to drowning.",
