The Ontario Forensic Pathology Service has been able to determine that the remains are that of a male age 50-100 years old. Found on him was Canadian currency dated 2016, therefore it is believed he may have been there as early as the Spring of 2016. It is unknown how the male travelled to this area, but it is believed that he may have taken a bus, walked or hitchhiked.  He was carrying a back pack with camping supplies along with a firearm that would have been concealed in a cardboard box. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified male is of European ancestry.",
