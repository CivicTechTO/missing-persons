    "CaseDesc": "On August 10, 2004, Mr. Lathlin was reported missing to police by his wife. She indicated to police the last time she saw Mr. Lathlin was on June 14th at which time he was leaving for Winnipeg from The Pas for a medical appointment on the 15th. He did not take any clothing and only took personal grooming items. Mr. Lathlin later called advising his wife he would be staying in Winnipeg as he had another appointment on Thursday. He again called his wife on Saturday morning asking for money. His wife sent the money as requested, however by Tuesday it was not claimed and it was returned to her. Mr. Lathlin has a history of living on the streets and has ties to Edmonton where he spent years on the street there. He also has various medical concerns. It is believed that Mr. Lathlin is likely in Winnipeg of his own volition. Mr. Lathlin's whereabouts remain unknown.",

A search was initiated and police found a boat submerged upright on the bottom of the lake. The depth of the lake around the boat was only 8 to 10 feet deep. It appeared to Police that the men encountered extremely rough water while crossing Moose Lake. The motors were both found to be in forward gear. There was no floatation gear in the boat and it was heavily loaded with camping and hunting equipment. All of the bodies were recovered with the exception of M. Garson. It is presumed Mr. Garson drowned.",
