On the return trip the men had to go to shore once to get out of the winds. They again departed despite the high winds on the lake which was causing the water to be extremely dangerous with high waves. Adolphe was in the lead boat with his hunting partner, and unbeknownst to him the second boat had to return to shore for motor repairs. Adolphe and his hunting partner never returned and were reported missing the next day. The body of Adolphe's hunting partner was discovered and the cause of death was determined to be drowning. It is assumed Mr. Thorassie also drowned.",

They described the waves as being three to four feet high and they could not see the tree line from where they were. They lost sight of the other two boats and fired shotgun shots into the air hoping for a response. No response was received.
