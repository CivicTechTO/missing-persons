They departed the Umpherville settlement around 1300hrs and they briefly stopped at Pine Bluff around 1600 hrs. It is believed they then stopped at a friends trappers cabin at Rat Hunting and ate a meal. The last thing the survivor remembers, is seeing the lights of Easterville and he crawled to the front of the boat where he fell asleep. He awoke around 0500 hrs the next day and Mr. Umpherville was no longer in the boat and he was adrift. Numerous islands in the area were searched, shorelines were searched and several air and water patrols were made without success. Mr. Umpherville has not been located and his whereabouts is unknown.",

    "CaseDesc": "The Gypsumville RCMP detachment received a report that an aircraft was in distress over Lake Winnipeg near Reindeer Island. The aircraft, a single engine Cherokee 140, had three people on board; the pilot and two passengers. The pilot had indicated that the engine had seized and that he was trying to make it to Reindeer Island. He then stated that he was going down in to the water. Two RCMP Twin Otters and an Air Search and Rescue Hercules conducted a search by air. It was not possible to search the lake by boat as there was too much ice on the lake. All three are presumed dead due to drowning or from the impact of the crash.",

On August 18, 1978, three members of the expedition were on shore guiding in a canoe. The remaining 5 members including Craig remained in the canoe. As these individuals labored to guide the canoe to shore, the rope was given some slack. This caused the bow of the canoe to turn out into the current, which in turn caused the canoe to tip. The individuals on shore were unable to hold onto the rope due to the strength of the current and the canoe was carried downstream. Craig hung onto the canoe for a couple hours then was seen letting go. He slipped under the water and did not resurface. Mr. Waldum's remains have not been recovered and foul play is not suspected in this matter.",
