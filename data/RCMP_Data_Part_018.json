They again departed despite the high winds on the lake which was causing the water to be extremely dangerous with high waves. Adolphe was in the lead boat with his hunting partner, and unbeknownst to him the second boat had to return to shore for motor repairs. Adolphe and his hunting partner never returned and were reported missing the next day. The body of Adolphe's hunting partner was discovered and the cause of death was determined to be drowning.
