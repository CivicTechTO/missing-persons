At approximately 7:30 p.m. that same day, the occupants of the first boat reported to the RCMP that the other two boats were missing. They described the waves as being three to four feet high and they could not see the tree line from where they were. They lost sight of the other two boats and fired shotgun shots into the air hoping for a response. No response was received. Extensive patrols by air, boat and land were made in an attempt to locate the remaining five men. The bodies of Fredrick Ursu and Jerry Hudy were never recovered.
