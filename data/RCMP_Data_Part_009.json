The investigation revealed that the deceased had at one time undergone reconstruction of the jaw. The facial bones were cut surgically and then moved, and the upper and lower jaws were re-adjusted, resulting in changes in the facial structure. It is also probable that the deceased had braces in adulthood. Spots on her lower teeth suggest that she might have been a smoker. She was believed to be in the tent for a day or two and not more than a week before she was discovered. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified woman is of European ancestry.",
