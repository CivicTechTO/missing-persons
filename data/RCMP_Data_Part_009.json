When they failed to return by the 22nd, numerous people contacted police. Through investigation it was later determined that both men were last seen by a man on shore on Sunday the 20th, and their camp was still set up. They told the individual that they were going to make one more pass and then intended to break camp. Weather conditions at the time were such that there would have been rough water. Given this and the fact that the men were in a fairly small canoe, it was determined they may have capsized. An extensive land, water and air search did not find anything other than various articles that were identified as belonging to the two missing fishermen. Mr. Simpson has never been located.",

    "CaseDesc": "On July 21, 1966, a friend asked Ronnie Harper to help him lift one of his nets out of the waters of Red Sucker Lake. The two men set off in a canoe. When they arrived at the site, the men pulled the line attached to the net, but it didn't move. Increasing their efforts, the men pulled harder and the line attached to the weight came loose. The sudden shift caused both men to lose their footing and the canoe to overturn. The men attempted to move closer to shore by pushing the canoe. After a time, Mr. Harper told his friend he was too tired to hold on any longer. His companion continued moving the canoe. The survivor then realized Mr. Harper was no longer hanging on. Efforts to locate Mr. Harper were unsuccessful and it is presumed he drowned.",
