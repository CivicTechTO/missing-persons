Her route took her west on Highway 16 through Hinton, then north on Highway 40. Witnesses saw Shelley-Anne walking westbound along the shoulder of Highway 16 carrying her school books; she was not hitch-hiking. Shelley-Anne was last seen in the area of what was then the western edge of town. A dark colored van was seen in the area around the time Shelley-Anne was walking home, some reports were that it was stopped at the side of the road near where she was last seen. An extensive search for the van and/or its occupants was not successful. Several days after Shelley-Anne was last seen, some of her belongings were found near the Athabasca River not far from the outskirts of Hinton.",

His post-mortem weight was recorded as being 200 lbs, however, this measurement may not represent his actual living weight due to post-mortem changes noted at autopsy. He is described as balding, however, due to the length of time spent in the water, it is possible that his hair was lost after death giving the appearance of male pattern baldness. He is uncircumcised. His appendix is present. Changes to his heart suggest that he had high blood pressure and may have been treated for this. It is believed that he was in the water for days to weeks prior to his discovery.",
