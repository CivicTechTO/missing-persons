This man denied harming Belinda and through a Polygraph examination was determined to be honest.  The Victoria Police investigated Belinda's disappearance and determined that Belinda suffered from a mental illness, had a drug addiction and may have been a sex trade worker.  The last confirmed sighting of Belinda was at Shoppers Drug Mart at 870 Esquimalt Rd.  She failed to attend thereafter to pick up her daily medication.",
