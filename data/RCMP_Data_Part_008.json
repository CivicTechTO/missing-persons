Mr. Nevin had a grandson in Winnipeg, Manitoba and a son in Prince George, British Columbia. Neither relative had prior notification Mr. Nevin's intentions to visit.   On June 14, 1979 the RCMP responded to a call and James Nevin's vehicle, a 1974 white/maroon Dodge Coronet, was located in a ditch between Rocanville, Saskatchewan and St. Lazare, Manitoba. Inquiries reveal the vehicle was at this location since June 8, 1979.   Mr. Nevin has never been seen again and likely went missing between 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm on June 8, 1979. Extensive searches were conducted by land and air all with negative results. James Gordon Nevin was never seen again. Foul play cannot be ruled out.",
