His post-mortem weight was recorded as being 200 lbs, however, this measurement may not represent his actual living weight due to post-mortem changes noted at autopsy. He is described as balding, however, due to the length of time spent in the water, it is possible that his hair was lost after death giving the appearance of male pattern baldness. He is uncircumcised. His appendix is present. Changes to his heart suggest that he had high blood pressure and may have been treated for this. It is believed that he was in the water for days to weeks prior to his discovery.",

The investigation revealed that the deceased had at one time undergone reconstruction of the jaw. The facial bones were cut surgically and then moved, and the upper and lower jaws were re-adjusted, resulting in changes in the facial structure. It is also probable that the deceased had braces in adulthood. Spots on her lower teeth suggest that she might have been a smoker. She was believed to be in the tent for a day or two and not more than a week before she was discovered. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified woman is of European ancestry.",
