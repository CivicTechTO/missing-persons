On August 18, 1978, three members of the expedition were on shore guiding in a canoe. The remaining 5 members including Craig remained in the canoe. As these individuals labored to guide the canoe to shore, the rope was given some slack. This caused the bow of the canoe to turn out into the current, which in turn caused the canoe to tip. The individuals on shore were unable to hold onto the rope due to the strength of the current and the canoe was carried downstream. Craig hung onto the canoe for a couple hours then was seen letting go. He slipped under the water and did not resurface. Mr. Waldum's remains have not been recovered and foul play is not suspected in this matter.",
