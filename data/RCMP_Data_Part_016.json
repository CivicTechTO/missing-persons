During the course of the day, poor weather rolled in and the water became quite rough. They started taking in water over the sides of the canoe. Despite the progress they made, one wave eventually rolled the canoe. Both men hung onto the canoe for hours, but Robert eventually tired and let go.  When the friend eventually reached shore, he reported the incident. Dragging and diving operations were initiated and the results were negative. Mr. Ellis is presumed to have drowned. No foul play is suspected in this case.",
