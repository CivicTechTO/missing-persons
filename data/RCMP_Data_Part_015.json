The group had planned to go out onto James Bay with the tide and sail to Moosonee by lashing their canoes together. An intense storm engulfed the James Bay coastal area on July 23, 1984, and it is likely that the party perished on the Bay during this storm. Three victims were recovered in August 1984, twelve nautical miles North of the Moose River. Mr. Grinnell's body has never been recovered.",
