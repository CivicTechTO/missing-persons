Both vessels proceeded west however after a time, the height of the waves increased (7 to 8 ft.). As a result the patrol boat had to increase power, which substantially increased the distance between the respective boats. Mr. Gorrie's boat was last seen a 1/2 mile behind the patrol. Immediate searches by air provided negative results. It is presumed that Mr. Gorrie drowned as he or the boat have never been located.",
