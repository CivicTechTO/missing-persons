    "CaseDesc": "In February 2013, a human skull was turned into Hinton RCMP by the Groeneveldt family. They located the skull in their garage under items that had been tucked away since the homeowner Leo Groeneveldt passed away many years earlier. The family believes Mr. Groeneveldt received the skull as a gag gift at a party he attended in Hinton in the late 1960s or early 1970s. The exact origin of the skull is unknown. Forensic examination of the skull shows it is that of an aboriginal male.",
