When 5 days passed and he hadn't returned home, his wife began to look for him and discovered that he had never arrived in Black River. On November 3, 1964, Mr. Hansen's boat was found turned over near Bigstone Point and was approximately 100 yards from the shore. Searches were done by air, land and boat but the body of Mr. Hansen was never recovered. Murray Hansen is presumed dead due to drowning.",
