    "CaseDesc": "On July 16, 1980, the skeletal remains of an unidentified man were found in a bush area on the east side of the 11th Concession, 1km north of Steeles Avenue in Markham. This man is believed to be between the ages of 30 to 50 years. His living height is estimated to be between 5'1\"-5'5\". Dark staining of his posterior teeth suggest that he may have been a smoker. Found in the vicinity of the remains were some clothing and effects, which may or may not be associated with the deceased. The clothing found included a pair of \"Brittania\" women's jeans (waist 30 inches, inseam 29 inches); a pair of white, ribbed socks; and a pair of red and pink high-heeled shoes. A compact containing powder and mirror was also found nearby. This man was believed to have been dead for 6 months to five years.",
