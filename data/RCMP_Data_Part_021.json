His post-mortem weight was recorded as being 145 lbs and his length was measured at 5'10\" to 5\u201911\u201d, however, these measurements may not represent his actual living weight and height due to post-mortem changes noted at autopsy. He has evidence of heart disease and may have had heart problems in the past. It is estimated that he had been in the water for a few days up to two weeks prior to discovery. Biogeographic Ancestry testing predicts that this unidentified male is of European ancestry.",

When they arrived at the site, the men pulled the line attached to the net, but it didn't move. Increasing their efforts, the men pulled harder and the line attached to the weight came loose. The sudden shift caused both men to lose their footing and the canoe to overturn. The men attempted to move closer to shore by pushing the canoe. After a time, Mr. Harper told his friend he was too tired to hold on any longer. His companion continued moving the canoe. The survivor then realized Mr. Harper was no longer hanging on. Efforts to locate Mr. Harper were unsuccessful and it is presumed he drowned.",
