Both vessels proceeded west however after a time, the height of the waves increased (7 to 8 ft.). As a result the patrol boat had to increase power, which substantially increased the distance between the respective boats. Mr. Gorrie's boat was last seen a 1/2 mile behind the patrol. Immediate searches by air provided negative results. It is presumed that Mr. Gorrie drowned as he or the boat have never been located.",

This man reported sharing an intimate relationship with Belinda outside of his own marriage.  He said she was not a habitual runaway.  This man denied harming Belinda and through a Polygraph examination was determined to be honest.  The Victoria Police investigated Belinda's disappearance and determined that Belinda suffered from a mental illness, had a drug addiction and may have been a sex trade worker.  The last confirmed sighting of Belinda was at Shoppers Drug Mart at 870 Esquimalt Rd.  She failed to attend thereafter to pick up her daily medication.",
