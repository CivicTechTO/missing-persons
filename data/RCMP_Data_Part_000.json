During this stop, they noticed a storm coming in. By the time they left there were already waves forming as they started out across the lake. The wind increased and the waves were so strong that they would almost cause the vessel to flip over. The boat filled with water and a wave took Mr. Harper out of the boat. His wife and child drifted in the boat until they reached shore and were later rescued. No foul play is suspected in this matter and it is presumed Mr. Harper drowned.",

On June 14, 1979 the RCMP responded to a call and James Nevin's vehicle, a 1974 white/maroon Dodge Coronet, was located in a ditch between Rocanville, Saskatchewan and St. Lazare, Manitoba. Inquiries reveal the vehicle was at this location since June 8, 1979.   Mr. Nevin has never been seen again and likely went missing between 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm on June 8, 1979. Extensive searches were conducted by land and air all with negative results. James Gordon Nevin was never seen again. Foul play cannot be ruled out.",
