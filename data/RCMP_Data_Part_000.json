She drove back through the Calais/St. Stephen border crossing into Canada. At the Canadian entry point Bonnie hit the customs booth causing minor damage to her car. She was last seen talking to the Customs Officer. The next morning her husband realized she was missing, and called the police. Bonnie's car was found abandoned on March 18, 1978, near St. Stephen on a logging road near the St Croix River.",
