    "CaseDesc": "On the evening of September 30, 1979, Adolphe Thorassie and three hunting partners were attempting to return home after a successful hunt. Two men were in each boat. On the return trip the men had to go to shore once to get out of the winds. They again departed despite the high winds on the lake which was causing the water to be extremely dangerous with high waves. Adolphe was in the lead boat with his hunting partner, and unbeknownst to him the second boat had to return to shore for motor repairs. Adolphe and his hunting partner never returned and were reported missing the next day. The body of Adolphe's hunting partner was discovered and the cause of death was determined to be drowning. It is assumed Mr. Thorassie also drowned.",

Weather conditions were very poor at the time and the boat eventually capsized some distance from shore, after taking on water. His friend managed to swim back to Fox Island but Mr. Giles was not able to make it to shore, due to the treacherous weather and water conditions. On November 20th, 1989 the boat was discovered stranded on a sandbank near Joyland Beach in Orillia. Mr. Giles' body has never been recovered.",

This man reported sharing an intimate relationship with Belinda outside of his own marriage.  He said she was not a habitual runaway.  This man denied harming Belinda and through a Polygraph examination was determined to be honest.  The Victoria Police investigated Belinda's disappearance and determined that Belinda suffered from a mental illness, had a drug addiction and may have been a sex trade worker.  The last confirmed sighting of Belinda was at Shoppers Drug Mart at 870 Esquimalt Rd.  She failed to attend thereafter to pick up her daily medication.",
