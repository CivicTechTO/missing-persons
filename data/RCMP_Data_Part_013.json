    "CaseDesc": "Tommy Charpentier worked on a farm and lived with his employer in Sainte-Brigitte-des-Saults. On the night of December 15, 2008, tracks in the snow indicate that he may have walked on the Nicolet River that passes in front of the farm. Mr. Charpentier\u2019s clothes were found on the frozen surface of the river, near an opening in the ice. This suggests that Mr. Charpentier may have jumped into the icy waters of the Nicolet River.",
