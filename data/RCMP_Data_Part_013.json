After numerous inquiries it was discovered M. Hudson left The Pas Manitoba on October 20th and arrived at Cedar Lake Post.  When he reached Cedar Lake, M. Hudson was advised by a friend to wait for a boat from Easterville which was expected shortly. A witness who spoke to M. Hudson indicated that he first left on foot for Easterville but turned back. He then took a canoe and started off for Easterville using a piece of board as a paddle. It is believed that Mr. Hudson had little or no food, no rifle or other camping gear. Numerous land, air and water patrols were made with negative results.",
